# facial_recognition

The following is a repository for a facial recognition service.

It works as follows:
1. For a given visitor, the system depicts their face and emails the service owner 
   whether to allow or deny them to access.

2. If allowed access, the service owner should be able to capture their information through a
   hosted webpage. Then an OTP will be sent to the visitor with that will last for 5 minutes.

3. For a returning visitor, the system automatically send them an SMS message with an OTP.
4. Given a valid OTP, a visitor should be able to input it and receive a personalized greeting.
